# Daily Stacker

Waking up to a little bit more crypto in your wallet is a great feeling. Daily Stacker wakes up before you do and buys you a little slice of your favourite tokens and sends them to your wallet.

## Background

Dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) combined with HODLing has been proven time and time again to be the best and simplest investment strategy to adopt. Don't try and time the market, don't try and catch the dips. Just buy at set intervals - daily, weekly, or monthly.

Daily Stacker takes DCA to a new level. Waking up everyday owning a little bit more crypto is a nice feeling and Daily Stacker helps achieve that. 

## How it works

Here's how Daily Stacker works:

1. connect your wallet and once a month transfer some ETH to Daily Stacker
2. setup a portfolio, e.g. 50% Wrapped Bitcoin, 35% LINK, 15% BAT
3. for the next 30 days Daily Stacker will buy slivers of the tokens according to the ratios in your portfolio
4. all purchases are automatically sent to your wallet

# History

Daily Stacker first came to life as a [Raspberry Pi project called SatStacker](https://github.com/ijonas/satstacker). SatStacker still runs today. However I collected a lot of feedback from people asking if they could a solution that they could run themselves without hardware.

Daily Stacker was born as part of the [Chainlink Fall 2021 Hackathon](https://chain.link/hackathon) where it was entered as a Solo Project.
